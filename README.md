## Metacade?
The Metacade API tool was originally released in 2017 on the [on the PixelTail forums](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/arcade-tool-for-people-who-want-to-mess-with-it/23715/). It allowed users to create interactive 2D games and was planned to allow their sharing with others through a virtual arcade in PixelTail's [Tower Unite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394690/Tower_Unite/). As of March 2023 the API has [not seen an update in 5 years](https://github.com/ZakBlystone/metacade/commits/master) nor has it been implemented into Tower Unite.

This repository is my attempt to create a game engine with the stylings and gameplay of the Sonic the Hedgehog games. It is currently in a very basic state and has no proper physics simulation. Expect bugs and jam.
