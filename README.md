## Metacade?
The Metacade API tool was originally released in 2017 on the [PixelTail forums](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/arcade-tool-for-people-who-want-to-mess-with-it/23715/) and allowed users to create their own 2D games. It was originally planed to be integrated into PixelTail's [Tower Unite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394690/Tower_Unite/) via a virtual arcade that would allow players to share and play their games together with other players, but as of March 2023 the API has [not seen an update in 5 years](https://github.com/ZakBlystone/metacade/commits/master) or implementation.

This repository is my attempt to create a game engine with the stylings and gameplay of classic Sonic games. It's currently in a prototype state with no proper physics or collsion, just a featureless flat plane that stretches to infinity (or until the numbers overflow).
