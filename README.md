## Welcome to the Development Branch!

Turns out that pushing my commits every four years makes the repo appear super dead (which it is). With this brand new branch I'm aiming to push out small commits as soon as they happen rather than when I've finished up a baker's dozen and feel like it's good to go as a massive package.
