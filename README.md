## What is this?
This is a work in progress Sonic engine created with the Metacade API found [on the PixelTail forums](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/arcade-tool-for-people-who-want-to-mess-with-it/23715/) that aims to emulate the physics from the 2D Sonic games and eventually become its own game! The Metacade API itself is to be used at a future date within the PixelTail's current early access title [Tower Unite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394690/Tower_Unite/) which will allow players to create and share their own arcade games.

I do not have much experience with a project as ambitious as this but I hope to both get a lot of experience through it and learn a ton through how physics work and the ways a game should be structured and stored with data. It is also my goal to create the engine without the use of any other external libraries besides the one provided by Metacade to display graphics and play back audio.

## How do I run it?
* Start by downloading the zip and extracting it into its own folder within the projects directory in the metacade folder.
* A download for metacade can be found over [on the PixelTail forums](https://forums.pixeltailgames.com/t/arcade-tool-for-people-who-want-to-mess-with-it/23715/).
* Open a command prompt within the metacade directory and start the program by executing `tool <project_folder_name>`

That's it! Have fun with my terrible prototype.

## Can I contribute?
For the time being I'm sailing this ship solo and do not have any plans to accept any pull requests. While it may be beneficial to allow contributions from all around to improve my code and make the whole thing a better experience I want the satisfaction of having created everything on my own. Forks are encouraged and the code can be used as one pleases but this branch will be on its own! Thank you for your understanding!
